My [last blog post](https://danils.xyz/blog/06-ddia-01) was about the three properties of a good data-intensive system.
That was from the first chapter of the book. Now I'm jumping to the 3rd chapter which is about storage and retrieval.
I don't make post about the 2nd chapter because in my opinion talking about the history of SQL and
the different data models and query languages is not really interesting.

## Log-structured and Page-oriented Storage

There are many different databases with many different storage engines.
But DDIA focuses on two categories of storage engines: **page-oriented** and **log-structured**.

Page-oriented storage engines are the traditional way of storing data in most relational databases.
They divide the data into small units of storage called **pages**, with each page typically sized at 4KB.
This is used by databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.

While log-structured storage engines are a newer way of storing data.
It's gaining rapid adoption in the database world due to its advantages in write-heavy workloads.
In this model, data is stored in an append-only sequence of **segments**.
This is used by databases like HBase, Cassandra, and LevelDB.

In this post, I'll talk only about log-structured storage even though chapter 3 of DDIA
contains a lot more than that. This is because I created many animations for this post
and it would be too much work to create animations for page-oriented storage too.
So I'll talk about page-oriented storage in another post.

## Basic Log-structured Storage

The basic idea of log-structured storage is to write new data sequentially to disk.
This is done by only doing append operations either for insert, update, or delete.

<Media
  src="/images/blogs/07/basic.mp4"
  sizes="640px"
  alt="Replication flow diagram"
  aspectRatio=""
  radius="l"
/>

For insert operation the new data is simply appended to the end of the log file.
For update operation, a new version of the data is appended to the log file without modifying the old version.
For delete operations, a tombstone entry is appended to the log file, which marks the data as deleted.

When handling read operations, the storage engine will look for the latest version of the data.

<Media
  src="/images/blogs/07/compaction.mp4"
  sizes="640px"
  alt="Replication flow diagram"
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="l"
/>

In the animation above, notice that even though b has an older value, but because it's marked as deleted
by a newer tombstone entry, the query returns not found. The same goes for a,
which returns the newer value (7) instead of the older value (3).

This design has several advantages over page-oriented storage:

1. **Sequential Write**: Writing data sequentially is faster than random writes.
2. **Compaction**: Old data can be removed by merging the log files into a
   new file, thus space can be reclaimed without requiring additional maintenance.
3. **Concurrency**: Since the log file is append-only, it's easier to handle concurrent writes.
4. **No In-place Updates**: Reduces data corruption risks during writes.

### Log Segments and Compaction

But if it only does append operations, won't the log grow indefinitely?

Yes, it will. But people have come up with a solution for that.

In a log-structured storage, the log is divided into segments. Each segment is a separate file,
with one segment handling the current writes. We'll call this the **active segment**.
When this active segment reaches a certain size or other criteria,
it will get "stashed away" as an **immutable segment** and a new active segment will be created.
This process is then repeated.

<Media
  src="/images/blogs/07/log-segments.mp4"
  sizes="640px"
  alt="Replication flow diagram"
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="l"
/>

Now that there are lingering segments, the storage needs to do something about them to keep disk usage in check.
So in the background, there will be a process that will merge the old segments into a single file
and then delete the old segments. This process is called **compaction**.

<Media
  src="/images/blogs/07/memtable-and-wal.mp4"
  sizes="640px"
  alt="Replication flow diagram"
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="l"
/>

During the compaction process, the storage engine will only preserve the latest version of the data.
This way the new segment will only contain a small subset of the data from the old segments. It will
also delete values which latest version is a tombstone.

In the animation above, even though d has an entry in the oldest segment with value (3), the one that gets preserved
in the new segment is the one from the newest segment with value (1). And notice that c doesn't get preserved,
since the latest version of c is a tombstone.

### Indexing

Alright, that's fine and all. But how do log-structured storage engines find the data they need?
Do they do linear search through the segments every time?

No, they don't. Just like in page-oriented storage, log-structured storage engines also have a way to index data.
The most basic form of indexing is to keep an in-memory index of the keys and their offsets in the log files.
Each segment has its own index.

<Media
  src="/images/blogs/07/indexing.mp4"
  sizes="640px"
  alt="Replication flow diagram"
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="l"
/>

In the animation above, assume each entry in each segment has the size of 1 byte.
The indexes that are generated have the key and the byte offset of the entry in the segment.
So something like `f -> 2` means that the entry with key f starts from byte 2 in the segment.

When a read operation is performed, the storage engine will first look at the in-memory index.
If the key is not found, it will look at the next segment's index, and so on.
Some optimizations can also be done to make it faster, such as using bloom filters.

But the downside of this indexing mechanism is that it has to keep every key and its offset in the index.
So if the dataset is large, the index will also be large.

## SSTable

SSTable is more advanced version of the basic log-structured storage.
It stands for **Sorted String Table** and came from Google's [BigTable paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf).
In an SSTable, data is still stored in log files, but on-disk they are sorted by keys.

But wouldn't that make the benefit of sequential write go away?

Yes, so to overcome that the data are not directly stored in the log files.
Instead, data are first written to an in-memory data structure called **memtable**.
Typically a self-balancing data structure is used for this, such as a skip lists or red-black tree.
This memtable will then get flushed to disk every time certain criteria is met such as
memtable size or time since the latest flush.

<Media
  src="/images/blogs/07/memtable-and-wal.mp4"
  sizes="640px"
  alt="Replication flow diagram"
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="l"
/>

When data is flushed to disk, notice that the data is sorted by keys.

SSTable has several advantages over the basic log-structured storage:

1. **Faster Reads**: Since the data is sorted by keys, reads can be faster.
2. **Range Queries**: Range queries can be done more efficiently.
3. **More Efficient Compaction**: Since the data is sorted by keys and
   there's no update and tombstone entries, the merging can be done more efficiently.

But what happens when the system crashes before the memtable is flushed to disk?

Aside from writing to the memtable, typically the storage engine will also write to a **write-ahead log (WAL)**.
It's an append-only log file that records every write operation, basically just like log file in basic log-structured storage.
Since sequential writes are fast, writing to the WAL is less of a risk.
When the system crashes, the storage engine can replay the WAL to recover the memtable.

Aside from having a memtable and a write-ahead log, there's not much difference between SSTable and
the basic log-structured storage.
SSTable also has the concept of segments and compaction with basically the same rules and mechanism.

That is, except for the indexing part.

### Indexing

Since the data is sorted by keys, SSTable can use a more efficient indexing mechanism.
Instead of having to have _every_ key and its offset in the log file, SSTable can just utilize
the property of the sorted data and store only _some_ of the keys and their offsets.
This is called a **sparse indexing**.

<Media
  src="/images/blogs/07/sstable-indexing.mp4"
  sizes="640px"
  alt="Replication flow diagram"
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="l"
/>

Notice that to search for the key `t`, the storage don't need to find `t` directly in the index.
It just needs to find the nearest key, that is `r`, and then linearly search from there.

This indexing technique also has the benefits that it doesn't get quite as large as basic hash
indexing technique previously mentioned.

That's it for this post. Hopefully with this I've solidified my understanding of the log-structured storage.
Note that this post is only based on my notes and understanding of the book.
Please correct me if I get something wrong about log-structured storage.
